#### Look Away to Pause Youtube - Experimental Chrome Extension


Chrome (v56+) has a new FaceDetector API which basically lets you detect faces in images easily, so what if we could pause Youtube when you look away or go for a sandwich 🥪?

## How to install
Download the Zip from this [release](https://github.com/Hemmingsson/Face-Pause/releases/tag/0.1), unzip it and load it as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

## Notice

- 🙀 I don’t trust my webcam and I have it covered, see this more as an experiment of Chromes new technology, than a product you'd use every day. 
- 🏴 To get the extension to work you’ll need to enable Chrome Experimental Features here: <br>
`chrome://flags#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`

- 💡If you’re in a dark setting it will probably be a bit buggy, as FaceDetector API is still not great in bad light. 

## Development

### Installation
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/Hemmingsson/Face-Pause`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build`

##### Load the extension in Chrome

2. Select "Developer Mode" and then click "Load unpacked extension..."
3. From the file browser, choose to `Face-Pause/build/chrome`


### Developing
The following task can be used when you want to start developing the extension

- `npm run chrome-watch`
